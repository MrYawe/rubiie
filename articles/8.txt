Delivery Costs Are Devouring Food Startups

Food tech is big these days - Grubhub, Blue Apron, Instacart - but pretty web design and polished communication strategies aren't enough to build a sustainable food business. No company will provide attractive gross margins without creating and executing a sustainable new paradigm for food delivery.

It comes down to perishability: Fresh food breaks tried and true delivery models, and drives costs through the roof.

In the mid-20th century, a visit from the milkman was part of the weekly routine. He'd start his morning at a dairy, then head door to door with his refrigerated truck full of freshly filled bottles, changing out old empties for new.

The Milk Run delivery model thrives when there's a stable route that can be continuously optimized as new deliveries are added; it's direct, efficient and provides reliable sales to the dairy - everyone wins. However, the Milk Run model has a critical weakness: It doesn't work whenever any variability is introduced; for example, if someone requested a different delivery time or wanted to order something different.
